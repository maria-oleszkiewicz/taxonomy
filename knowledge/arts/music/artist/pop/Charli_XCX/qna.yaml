      ## Background and release

      Brat is Charli XCX's sixth studio album and first after renewing her
      contract with Atlantic Records in early 2023. It was announced on 28
      February 2024, a day before the release of the lead single "Von Dutch".


      According to Charli XCX, Brat is her "most aggressive and confrontational
      record", but also her most vulnerable. On 22 February, during her Boiler
      Room warehouse set, she debuted snippets of tracks identified as "Spring
      Breakers" and "365". She was joined onstage by Addison Rae and Julia Fox;
      a "Von Dutch" remix with Rae and A. G. Cook was released on 22 March. On 6
      March, she premiered "So I" at the Billboard Women in Music event. "Club
      Classics" and "B2B" were released on 3 April as a two-pack promotional
      single.


      After teasing the song for a few days, on 29 April, Charli announced the
      release of the next single, "360". It was released on 10 May alongside its
      music video, which was teased earlier that day, and was described by her
      as her "best music video ever". The video features multiple "it girls",
      including Gabbriette, Chloë Sevigny, Julia Fox, and Rachel Sennott. A
      remix of "360" soon followed, featuring Swedish artists Robyn and Yung
      Lean, which was released on 31 May. During her 1 June headlining set at
      Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival, she debuted two unreleased songs
      live, "365" and "Everything Is Romantic".


      Brat was released on 7 June 2024. A deluxe edition, titled Brat and It's
      the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, was released on 10
      June, containing three additional songs. On 21 June, a remix version of
      "Girl, So Confusing" featuring New Zealand singer Lorde was released. On 1
      August 2024, a remix version of "Guess" from the deluxe edition was
      released featuring singer Billie Eilish. The following day, "Apple" was
      released to Italian radio as the album's third single. On 12 September, a
      "Talk Talk" remix featuring Troye Sivan was released along with the
      announcement of a remix album titled Brat and It's Completely Different
      but Also Still Brat scheduled for 11 October 2024.

  - context: >-
      ## Composition

      Brat channels the illegal London rave scene, where Charli XCX started
      performing as a teenager. She also mentioned that Brat "is probably the
      closest album to [her 2017 mixtape] Pop 2 in its ethos". It has been
      described as consisting of electropop, club-pop, hyperpop, electroclash,
      and dance styles. Charli XCX told Billboard's Katie Bain that Brat is
      produced from a tight collection of sounds to create "this unique
      minimalism that is very loud and bold". The Face's Shaad D'Souza compared
      the album's sound to 2000s-era Ministry of Sound compilations The Annual
      and Rihanna's 2010 album Loud, calling the lyrics "shady and bratty, but
      tender and heartbreaking".


      Charli XCX has confirmed that track "Girl, So Confusing" explores her
      contentious relationship with a fellow female artist. Listeners speculated
      that the track was about Marina Diamandis, Rina Sawayama, or Lorde, whom
      the track was later confirmed to be about. Lorde then appeared on the
      song's remix version. "Sympathy Is a Knife" alludes to another similar
      situation; the song has been speculated to be about her relationship with
      Taylor Swift, as well as Charli's perception of her relationship with the
      1975's lead singer Matty Healy.


      "Rewind" was written as a direct response to the success of "Speed Drive"
      from Barbie the Album. "Mean Girls", a song partially inspired by Red
      Scare co-host Dasha Nekrasova and actress and model Julia Fox, focuses on
      society's "fascination with mean girls". The Face called the track "So I"
      "a knotty exploration of her grief about [the death of] Sophie". "Apple"
      was written with inspiration from the writing style of Charli XCX's close
      friend and collaborator Caroline Polachek. "I Think About It All The Time"
      sees Charli XCX contemplating motherhood after meeting her friend and
      collaborator Noonie Bao's baby. In an interview before Brat's release, she
      said: "am I less of a woman if I don't have a kid? Will I feel like I've
      missed out on my purpose in life? I know we're not supposed to say that,
      but it's this biological and social programming."


      Brat's deluxe version adds three new songs. "Hello Goodbye" was described
      as "crush-addled". On "Guess", Charli XCX challenges a subject to guess
      the color of her underwear, which critics called "unapologetically flirty
      and suggestive". "Spring Breakers" suggests that Charli XCX's edginess
      bars her from music industry events such as the Grammy Awards.

          don't have a kid? Will I feel like I've missed out on my purpose in

          showcasing her unapologetically flirty style. Additionally, "Spring
          Breakers" hints at how her edginess might affect her standing in the
          music industry, particularly regarding high-profile events like the
          Grammys.

      ## Artwork and marketing

      Anticipating the release of Brat, the cover art of Charli XCX's
      discography was updated across streaming platforms to match its
      appearance.


      Brat's artwork and packaging was designed by New York City-based studio
      Special Offer, Inc. The cover is a lime green square with the title in
      lowercase imposed in Arial font. In a cover story interview for Vogue
      Singapore, Charli told Chandreyee Ray that criticism led her to question
      why fans feel "ownership over female artists" so much so that they demand
      their photograph be on all their work; she had previously called it
      "misogynistic and boring" on X. Of the album cover's colour—which is
      specifically Pantone 3507C—she said that green was heavily oversaturated
      in the media and fashion: "I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend
      shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for
      us to question our expectations of pop culture—why are some things
      considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad? I'm interested
      in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing
      things to be nice".


      Despite its simple appearance, the album cover's design underwent a
      five-month development process, maintaining a green square with text.
      Freaney selected the colour after examining around 500 shades, aiming for
      an off-putting, garish effect. The final shade resonated with Charli's
      vision of bold irreverence. The typography, based on Arial, was chosen for
      its non-"precious" feel. While considering various Swiss typefaces,
      Freaney wanted to surpass Helvetica. The text, slightly stretched to "give
      it a personality", is awkwardly placed to be neither small and tasteful
      nor large and loud, creating an opinion-less aesthetic.


      In the weeks leading up to Brat's release, a wall in Greenpoint,
      Brooklyn—which fans called the "brat wall"—was painted and repainted with
      the album's signature green color and various messages. Over the summer,
      its messages changed frequently in line with the album's promotion cycle.
      The first message was "i'm your fav reference"—a lyric from the single
      "360"—before it was repainted to simply "brat". On June 10, when Brat's
      deluxe edition was released, the wall was changed to white with the
      message "brat and it's the same but there's three more songs so it's not".
      By the middle of June, the wall remained white but changed its message to
      "lorde", indicating Lorde's possible involvement with future releases
      pertaining to Brat, which soon appeared in the remix version of "Girl, So
      Confusing". The final message of the Brat wall—"ok bye!" in the album's
      signature green—was painted on July 1.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the brat album cover font
        answer: ' The brat album cover cover is a lime green square with the title in lowercase imposed in Arial font.'
      - question: 'What is the story behind the brat album cover '
        answer: >-
          Even though it looks simple, the album cover took five months to
          design. It features a green square with text. Charlis' team picked the
          color after looking at about 500 shades, trying for a bright, striking
          look. The final color matched Charli's idea of being bold and
          different. The text, based on Arial, was chosen because it feels
          casual. Her team also looked at different Swiss fonts, wanting to do
          better than Helvetica. The text is stretched a bit to make it unique
          and is placed in a way that’s not too small or too big, giving it a
          neutral look.
      - question: 'How was the brat album advertised '
        answer: >-
          In the weeks before Brat's release, a wall in Greenpoint, Brooklyn,
          known as the "brat wall," was painted green and filled with different
          messages. Over the summer, the messages changed often to promote the
          album.

      ## Impact

      People's Sadie Bell linked the album cover with the nature of the album,
      which Charli XCX called "confrontational". Dubbed the "Brat summer" trend,
      the style of album cover and the specific shade of green became a viral
      sensation after a "Brat generator" tool surfaced online that allowed users
      to replicate the cover with their own custom text. The London Eye landmark
      was lit up in lime green on the day of the album's release. National
      Geographic acknowledged the album and the "brat girl" persona in a
      Brat-themed article discussing rebellious female icons throughout history,
      including Cleopatra, Wu Zetian, Lucrezia Borgia, Georgiana Cavendish, and
      Aurore Dupin (aka George Sand).


      ### In political campaigning

      As part of their 2024 United Kingdom general election campaign, the Green
      Party of England and Wales posted a replica of the album cover to social
      media that read "vote green" instead of "brat".[55] Mayor of London Sadiq
      Khan received a mixed response when replicating the cover on his Instagram
      to promote the success of the Ultra Low Emission Zone scheme.


      After Joe Biden decided to withdraw from the 2024 U.S. presidential
      election, the official Biden-Harris campaign profile renamed itself
      "Kamala HQ" and changed its banner picture in imitation of the album
      cover, replacing "brat" with "kamala hq". This occurred after Charli XCX
      tweeted about Harris on X (formerly Twitter), saying "kamala IS brat".
      Charli XCX later stated that although not meant as an explicit
      endorsement, she was "happy to help prevent democracy from failing
      forever". Multiple TikTok videos have shown edits of songs from the album
      with footage of Harris in the background. Some analysts have suggested the
      connection between the campaign and album will create enthusiasm among
      young voters.
